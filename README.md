# Introduction
I'm **Akshata Annigeri**, currently residing in **Chicago, USA**. I am from karnataka, **India**. I hold a bachelor's degree in engineering and have gained valuable experience working in the IT field for three years. I had to move to the United States about a year ago with my husband, and I seized the opportunity to pursue a master's degree in data analytics. Beyond the world of data, my interests lie in painting, cooking, and dancing.
